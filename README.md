Developed with Unreal Engine 5

The game is an attempt to create a game, start to finish, only in C++.  If there are any bugs, please comment down below, and I'll try to fix them.
The inspiration comes from Sebastian Lague's Make a Unity Game series on Youtube. I tried to make his game in the series in Unreal Engine without watching his videos and only the demo.

The main concept that intrigued me was the procedural map generation. The map in my video makes sure that every clear tile is accessible from every other clear tile.

Furthermore, this was also an attempt to create a very simple enemy AI using Behaviour Trees only in C++
